# JavaScript Style Guide

An opinionated and adequately reasonable guide to writing JavaScript

## Naming

### Files

#### PascalCase

- Component file names
- If a folder that functions as a component (i.e. contains an index.js which exports a component)
- Stories files (`.stories.js`)
- Test files of components (`.test.js`, `.spec.js`)

#### kebab-case

- Directory names should be kebab-case
<!-- TODO: maybe not?  most of our files are camelCase -->
- Non-component javascript files

### Booleans

Boolean variables should be prefixed with "is", "has", "should", or another similar modal auxiliary verb.

### Component naming standards

#### Parent-child relationships

- Child components that are tightly coupled with their parent should include the parent component name as a prefix.

- If a component only makes sense in the context of a single parent component, that relationship should be evident in its name.

- This naming convention should continue down the chain of parent/child relationships between components. For example if I have a `AppDrawer` component, which has a component which contains a list of navigation links called `AppDrawerNav`, then its child link component would be named `AppDrawerNavLinks`.

#### Order of words

- Component names should start with the highest-level (often most general) words and end with descriptive modifying words. For example...

```
components/
  app/
    AppDrawer.js
    AppDrawerFooter.js
    AppDrawerHeader.js
    AppDrawerHeaderLogo.js
    AppDrawerNav.js
    AppDrawerNavLink.js
```

- Do not place the modifier words at the beginning of the component name. Although it may read more like plain english this way, it will cause your components to be unorganized in the code editor, as well as increase the possibility of naming conflicts.

<!-- These are bad examples from a previous styleguide, TODO: grab better examples from Vision codebase -->
```
üëé BAD 
components/ 
  ClearSearchButton.js
  LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.js
  RunSearchButton.js
  SearchInput.js
  TermsCheckbox.js
```

```
üëç GOOD
components/
  SearchButtonClear.js
  SearchButtonRun.js
  SearchInputQuery.js
  SettingsCheckboxTerms.js
  SettingsCheckboxLaunchOnStartup.js
```

## Directory structure

### Each component folder or subfolder should have tests and stories folders
<!-- We may consider using a `__stories__` folder instead? -->
- Each folder containing component files should contain a `__tests__` folder and a `stories` folder.
